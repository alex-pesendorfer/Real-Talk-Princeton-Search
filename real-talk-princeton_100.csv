0,I love you RTP,love you more
1,Are most people doing Wintersession or just staying home and Vibing?,Response from Chewy:A good amount of people are doing each.
2,What do people wear for senior prom?,Response from Olive:I would think any kind of typical prom attire would be okay but maybe dress a bit lighter since Dillon will probably be hot when it happens 
3,"applying to the japan global seminar. a little unsure of if i should try to tailor my resume?? i am a cos major, so my resume is more tech focused. the only things on there that relate to the seminar is my coursework, my intended certificate in EAS, and (maybe?) a translating position for TED Talks","Response from Olive:I think what you mentioned should be sufficient to add if it isn’t much work to change up your resume, but you could also mention them elsewhere in the application if there’s space for it. I think most seminars highly value student interest so getting that across is really important "
4,when does add drop start for spring?,Response from Olive:the 23rd
5,"hi there, class of '21; i had never really considered grad school during my time at princeton, so no i never really focused on building strong relationships with professors and doing extra work in related fields of interest. however, since graduating im starting to really consider the possibility of grad school. does anyone have ideas/suggestions about how to navigate such a situation, especially if i didn't build close relationships with professors in undergrad?","Response from Chewy:You can email some professors who have taught you in your field of interest about your interest in grad school and if they’d be willing to discuss this opportunity with you, but you may need to follow up with them often to get a response.Recommendation letters can also come from work supervisors who can vouch for your skills applicable to grad school. You can also ask for projects if your work is related to your field of interest.It is very possible to get into grad school with a couple of years of work experience! You will be in good hands if your passion for research shines through."
6,which courses/departments have the worst grade deflation?,"Response from Chewy:It’s hard to say since grade deflation can often be confused with classes that are graded harshly or have a different curving system.Some classes have a higher threshold for an A as a 94 or 95 instead of a 93, for example, but we aren’t sure which departments mandate that entirely across classes. Other departments with low GPAs, such as engineering and chemistry, are often very difficult, which isn’t grade deflation but rather the nature of the subject.You can take a look at the below link for GPAs per department.The decline and fall of grade deflation"
7,Will I be able to receive packages during wintersession?,Response from Chewy:Yup.
8,favorite places to buy affordable business casual?,"Response from Ocean:Thrift stores – Greene Street especially has this kind of stuff, but also Nearly New, Goodwill, or whatever your local thrift store is. I also shop sales/markdowns at the higher-end stores, my favorite being Banana Republic because they always have a clearance section with good markdowns and because they specifically carry a size range that works for me. readers? "
9,"tips for applying to study abroad programs (more specifically, the summer language learning programs)? I haven’t applied to any programs or study abroad as a freshman and I’m not sure what I can write about in essays etc… so any advice would be much appreciated! also wondering if I’m allowed to get a recommendation from a prof in the language department of the country which I’m applying to (granted I’ve taken a course in the dept) or if I should ask a prof/preceptor of a different course?","Response from Ocean:Yes, you can get a rec from a prof in the language dept of the program you’re applying to (as long as it doesn’t specifically say that you can’t, but I think that would be a bit weird). Usually they recruit students already taking courses in those depts anyway.Make sure you’ve completed the minimum requirements before you apply, for the language programs there are usually prerecs (typically 1-2 years worth of courses in the dept, but if you tested out then that counts too). As for what to write–just talk about why you want to take the course! Speak a little bit about how it fits into your academic goals and plans, especially if you plan to continue with the language or use information about the language/country in your future studies or independent work. (As a freshman, it’s a bit early to be thinking about independent work, but if anything comes to mind related to the program then that would be useful to add. Obviously they’re not going to hold you to it 2-3 years later.)If your studies are totally unrelated to the language/country, speak about why you’re interested, why you study the language, and what you might bring to the classroom in terms of a different perspective, etc. "
10,"I'm interested in Princeton's summer program Kierkegaard in Copenhagen and will likely apply.  Do you happen to know how selective the program is -- acceptance rate and/or number of students who attend?  Also what's it like -- are the lectures interesting/challenging?  How heavy is the workload?  Any feedback on residential life -- dorms, dining, people etc.  Lastly, any advice on the application?  Thanks!","Response from Ocean:From what I can tell based on a quick Google search, the last time this course was offered was Summer 2019. Even I wasn’t at Princeton then, and I’m an ancient senior. As for selectivity, it will really depend on how many students apply, which can’t really be accurately predicted after a 4 year gap (and since these things change year to year). If you’re interested though, I’d encourage you to apply! You can also email the contacts in OIP or the professor to ask more specific questions. Here’s the course brochure in GPS with more info. "
11,"Actually fuck the grade deflation here yo. I really, really wish I went to Brown now. OOF","Response from Chewy:Princeton is quite tough, so it’s ok to feel this! GPA doesn’t really matter compared to your research and leadership in extracurricular activities toward your success in grad school, jobs, or anything else you’re considering. Many classes here will give many As, so ask around!"
12,What happens if I call the CPS CARES line? Should I use a fake Caller ID?,"Response from Olive:don’t think we have experience with this since it’s a relatively new resource, but you could do that or use other methods of anonymous calling like *67 to hide your number. I think in any scenario they would only ever report you if they have reason to believe that you would actually go through with an attempt rather than just expressing you have a feeling to do so"
13,have any seniors received tigerstay confirmation? they said you should receive confirmation within a few business days and I submitted the form within the first three minutes and they didn't close the form until the next day so just wondering if I was quick enough lol,Response from Chewy:I got a tigerstay confirmation after my submission. It should come from the email tigerstay@princeton.edu. Check your spam just in case.
14,Are there good spaces on campus to do virtual therapy appointments? I have roommates so I’m not sure I will be able to do them in my room,Response from Olive:the usg put out this resource last spring
15,should all final grades be finalized already or are changes still being made? if so then when is the final final deadline?,"Response from Chewy:Grades should’ve been finalized by 1/9, so if they haven’t been posted, you can request an update from your professor regarding this issue."
16,"Translation is unique because translation is the best. You learn theory in some classes, practice in otheds, and discover real-world stakes of the presence and absence of compassion in translation and the devastating or life-improving effects it could have.",thanks for your perspective!
17,what's unique about Translation and Intercultural Communication majors at Princeton?,"readers?Response from Ocean:Translation & Intercultural Communication isn’t a major at Princeton, it’s a certificate. I’m getting the certificate, and I enjoyed it very much. The classes are very interesting and engaging with amazing professors that help tailor the courses specifically to the strengths and knowledge of the students in the class. Because of Princeton’s small class sizes, this works really well and the program is shaped around the principles of small seminars, lots of class discussion and practice, and learning from the professor as well as other students and guest speakers. TRA200 last semester had a guest speaker every week, from all aspects of translation–we learned about interpreting, the history of translation (ancient and modern), the publishing industry and how to become a published translator, machine translation, and more. Translation isn’t studied as a practice in itself in many places, so Princeton is unique in that. All of the faculty in the department are published translators, and there is also a translator-in-residence. I’d highly recommend taking at least one course in the department if you’re at all interested. It’s also a very flexible certificate, and you can use related courses from language departments, linguistics, or psychology to count. As with all things at Princeton, there is also an independent work component–either your thesis or junior paper must incorporate translation in some regard. This is also pretty flexible, and you can speak with the departmental representative Yolanda Sullivan to get more information (she’s very nice!). "
18,is a 3.4 gpa good enough for grad school or is this a sign that i should abandon my academic ambitions and consider an alternative career as like a chef,"Response from Fallon: definitely depends on the field you’re trying to get into and so this is a much needed conversation to have with someone at the career center who can give you a much more accurate assessment. also, i’ve found not thinking about academic goals like this with an either/or mindset to be helpful and reassuring. hang in there, you got this!Response from Heisenberg:What Fallon said, but if you wanted a figure, an MIT EECS AO told me it was 3.5, so give or take 3.5 for other disciplines. So you’re in the ballpark (plus, research experience and letters of rec are more important anyway)"
19,where can I find the notification date / response deadline for HMEI internships? or what has it been in the past?,"Response from Olive:I don’t think it’s posted on the website and I think we get this question every year because it depends on the organization you apply for and their process, but it could be helpful to reach out to an HMEI contact and see if they can share anymore info"
20,Is the Liman fellowship selective?,"Response from Olive:I don’t know too much about it, but it seems they only award it to 4 students across all years and likely draws a lot of attention from pre-law students where internships are probably already pretty competitive, so I would say so"
21,"I'm a sophomore history student considering whether to take 3 seminars and a lecture course this coming semester. A couple of my friends have warned me against it, arguing that it will be too much work or too much class time... But I kind of want to try it. Any advice—or has anyone had experience w/ 3 seminars that they could share?",Response from Olive:personally don’t have this experience (haven’t even taken one 3 hour seminar) but I think you should do what you think is right and not what others think since everyone has their own learning style. if you prefer more discussed based and in-depth courses then seminars could be a really good fit for you. I think the extra work / time argument they claim isn’t really valid since meeting 1 day a week for 3 hours would just be a more condense version of meeting 2 or 3 times a week for shorter and with essentially the same amount of work depending on the professor. if they’re classes you’re really interested in and you can see yourself enjoying them and actively participating for the weekly meeting I would encourage you to at least try the arrangement and if by the second week you aren’t feeling it you can swap classes. readers with more extensive experience feel free to share!
22,is cps available/could i meet with a counselor during winter session?,Response from Olive:you should be able to since all campus offices should be reopened by now. if you need to schedule an initial consultation you can do so through the uhs portal or can call the office for other inquiries.
23,difference between class day and commencement day? Which do we get 6 tickets to?,Response from Olive:the commencement week events are summarized here. you’ll get 6 tickets for commencement
24,"Is there a best (or worst) time for senior sales (clothing and such) in terms of likelihood of getting traffic on your slides and actually selling stuff? Like I know there’s a whole bunch in the late spring, is it better to get ahead of those or does being part of a large group where people are used to looking at sales help?","Response from Heisenberg:Actually an interesting optimization problem, one could prob do research on this lol. I would say being part of the herd that sells at the same time could help in the manner that you referenced, though I’d probably try not to sell at a time when people are busy (late spring kinda sus?).Personally, if I was looking to buy, a standalone message in my inbox about your sale would catch my attention more than a stream of ppl trying to sell me their clothes. Certainly I would look at the stream of sellers too, but assuming I’m only looking to buy one batch of clothes from one seller and I pick one seller at random, the individual probability of an individual seller (say, you) successfully selling your stuff to me is less, I’d say, if you sell along this stream of other sellers compared to the standalone message."
25,genuine question - what makes writing sem so difficult to get an a in? is it the amount of work they assign? or the rubrics the professors use to grade? or something else?,"Response from Heisenberg:TL;DR: ppl summarize the evidence in their papers instead of writing analytically rigorous arguments. Bit lengthy, from my experiences, and obv doesn’t speak for everyone but here are my 2 cents.I’ve found that it’s because students typically don’t know how to go in-depth with the literature of their topic. That is, effectively organizing a cohesive argument, finding nuances within the arguments and creating novel points to argue for, and perhaps even adding to the academic conversation (the “literature”) about the topic with one’s own ideas instead of merely providing a summary of the evidence with no new ideas. Writing seminar is NOT designed to teach you how to write for the New York Times or how to publish a best-selling book. It is designed to demonstrate how you should interact with the literature of your chosen topic in preparation for independent work later on at Princeton. Notice how I phrased that: yes, engineers, this applies to you as well. Indeed, very talented writers may find themselves struggling in writing seminar not because they suddenly lost their ability to write but rather because of the different context under which they write.More often than not, what ends up happening is people just write the basic 5-paragraph essay they learned in high school that’s very “robotic” and doesn’t allow for the flexibility of going deep into a particular nuance while having the flexibility to pivot/transition to the next argument and how it could relate. It’s like thesis: here’s what I think -> now here’s reason 1 -> now here’s reason 2 which doesn’t really flow from reason 1 but is another reason that I think is valid nonetheless -> another reason 3 that may or may not make improve their paper’s quality -> conclusion that just summarizes the paper. This demonstrates your ability to read from the assigned readings, clearly, but not necessarily your ability to actually synthesize what you’ve read and write an analytically rigorous paper.Regarding the workload, I actually don’t think it’s as bad as people make it out to be. You get some assigned readings that may take ~90-120 minutes to read through it all (but you have the entire week to do so) and then you just write papers ranging from ~5-12 pages (I forget how long exactly but it’s not excruciatingly long). The issue is the onslaught of work comes from refining the quality of your produced works and NOT from the volume of the work. Others just end up procrastinating on their work (maybe because they were assigned an uninteresting writing sem or what have you), which you can imagine would make the class harder. It’s especially understandable, though, since the transition to life at Princeton certainly takes some time to adjust to.What I think the two biggest problems are: 1). most papers just end up being a summary with no analytical rigor, or 2). they might bring up novel arguments but they’re non-rigorous and often biased by their past beliefs.The former is what makes people say that writing seminar is “hard” because they’ve simply never written anything that has required this much work to write with ironclad rigor. The latter is what makes people say writing sem is “BS” or that it’s “not applicable to other classes,” and it actually occurs quite a bit. I’ve literally heard people self-proclaim that they have this uncanny ability to wiggle themselves out of any paper by making up some argument that may sound profound or superficially spectacular but is actually unfounded once granularly dissected. Granted, this approach may actually work in some classes here, but it ain’t gonna work in writing seminar. This ends up being a revelation for a lot of students and it’s the main reason why students are unhappy with their B on any given paper: thinking that their arguments were sound but in reality there were numerous illogical jumps and inconsistencies in their paper.I remember some of my friends fuming about their R1/2/3 grades and were intent on giving their professor a piece of their mind at office hours, but then I would read their papers and see exactly what their professor were talking about. Obviously, I would try to sympathize with their situation and offer some constructive feedback in case they wanted another viewpoint on it. But it’s almost like cognitive dissonance when this is the first time that freshmen receive actual critical feedback in their life. Referring back to the first paragraph about talented writers, some may actually choose to maintain their belief that their writing ability is infallible. They conclude their professor must be mistaken and so they never actually change their writing habits and end up bombing the course.It’s interesting because you can imagine this is more likely to happen if you got into a writing sem with a topic you’re really “comfortable” with. This is because you’re more inclined to not objectively look at what the assigned readings (the evidence/literature) say because you already have such a molded idea of what you think is “right” in your mind.Combine this with the fact that there is really no rubric per se (the profs just feel whether it’s an A, B, or C paper lol) and a group of students accustomed to perfectly following very specific rubrics that would guarantee them an A in any assignment during high school and you have some very unhappy freshmen.Thank you for coming to my TED Talk."
26,Can I reuse my COS IW for the SML certificate IW requirement?,Response from Olive:yup as long as it has significant statistics / machine learning content in it
27,how competitive is corporate contacts? what are the best ways to get involved in business today?,"Response from Chewy:Corporate contacts is very competitive as it is a great internship opportunity for first and second-years that often leads to internships at big-name companies for the following years and officer positions at Business Today (BT). Other ways to get involved in BT include staffing one of their conferences, such as Boost, DN, and IC, or being on one of their teams, such as content and seminars."
28,"Is it worth it to go to winter session and meet new people/hang out with friends or should I just stay home, relax, and spend more time with my family?","Response from Olive:personally would do whatever you feel more like doing. it’s a break, so I would suggest you go wherever you feel most comfortable and relaxed. if you like being home with your family then stay home, and if you prefer your friends or socializing with new people go to wintersession instead. both choices are completely valid ones to make, but your choice should be whichever would help you enjoy break the most."
29,What kind of courses are offered during the summer? Does financial aid cover the tuition?,"Response from Olive:you can find last summer’s offerings here. they can change a bit year to year but some of the more common courses like mat201/mat202/eco100 will usually always be offered. the question of financial aid is a bit vague according to past submissions and I want to say it won’t cover a summer course since you’re only eligible for 8 semesters of financial aid, but I think you may be able to apply for funding on SAFE to help cover costs. "
30,A C- is a pass right?,Response from Chewy:Indeed.
31,Re chewy: Considering switching to ORF so 310 doesn’t impact departmental gpa much…got an A from 362 this sem and I think if I do well on enough ORF departmentals maybe this won’t be a huge issue,"Response from Chewy:Then go for it if you do well on ORF departmentals! You have time to adjust your major.I will say that departmental GPA really doesn’t matter in terms of employment if that’s your goal, as my overall GPA is much better than my ECO one. One or two B+ doesn’t really hurt in the long term."
32,are peer career advisers available to meet over wintersession or do we have to wait until the semester starts?,"Response from Olive:I tried looking through the schedule on Handshake and they don’t seem to be, but the career center is having drop-in advising (no appointment required) virtually from 2-4pm M-Th and 12-4pm F under the “events” tab if you still want to meet with someone soon."
33,"Housing says my prox access to the dorms is suspended from noon on Monday, December 26th through Friday, January 13th, so when is the absolute earliest I could get in?",Response from Olive:not sure what time prox access is typically restored but I want to say midnight but any readers with a different experience feel free to correct
34,can't find this on the financial aid website for some reason - when does the financial aid application for the 2023-24 school year open? thanks!,"Response from Chewy:The fin aid application likely opens March 15, 2023, with a deadline of May 1st, 2023. These dates are based on a timeline found at the link below for 2022:Apply for Aid"
35,Raw score 86 ended up with a b+ in eco310….considering changing my major rn..I thought the curve for this class was supposed to be very generous…?,"Response from Chewy:Perhaps 50% of the class had a better grade than an 86, which is quite unfortunate, but that is how the grading curve works in that class.Also, I got a B+ in ECO 310, yet I still did much better in my subsequent classes in Economics, assuming that is the major you are considering. If you are in ORF, on the other hand, then you can take some time to reconsider or decide to push on forward."
36,are you supposed to respond to recruiters' messages on handshake? or are they automated/sent to a lot of people at once?,"Response from Chewy:You don’t have to. The messages are sent to many people at once, and sometimes they never respond even if you send them a message."
37,do matriculate advising fellows ever get matriculate merch? if so when?,"Response from Chewy:Yes, they do! When I was in it, the merch arrived the following semester, but the timeline may be different now. I would contact HAFs for more information."
38,"Would anyone care if I use Grindr on-campus and saw my profile or those that I invite to my dorm? It seems like every single selective club depends on people's opinion of you, unfortunately...","Response from Olive:I think princeton is generally pretty accepting of the lgbt+ community, although of course there are people who are not. I would do whatever you feel most comfortable with as I’m sure being gay / being on grindr isn’t something that people would hold against you since this is a pretty liberal leaning institution. you can always take protective measures if you’re worried about people finding out such as not putting any public pictures, only sending them to those you feel comfortable with, etc."
39,can you get a peer tutor through your res college for cos 226?,"Response from Olive:it’s not among the list of courses they usually solicit tutors for but they do offer an opportunity for interested students to offer any additional classes they’d be interested in tutoring, so there may be a tutor available if you ask. I think the COS courses tend to have more class resources available such as preceptors and office hours since they’re usually larger, so I would take advantage of those as well"
40,"are all dhalls open during wintersession, or just a select few?","Response from Chewy:Roma, Yeh/NCW, and CJL starting 1/15. Butler starting 1/22. Everywhere else 1/28.Wintersession 2023"
41,how much physics is in CEE102B (STL)?,Response from Olive:it’s not a pre-req so you can assume no physics knowledge is expected or required and any that is should be accessible to someone from a non-stem background
42,Why do I need an employment recommendation for Reunions jobs lol? How is delivering beer to drunk people competitive?,"Response from Olive:it’s not competitive, but they want to make sure they’re hiring people with decently good judgement, especially those that handle alcohol, which is why they ask for a recommendation"
43,"@the pre draw single question, unless it's different this year, you can usually use that space to list someone who you want to be in a single next door to you! so you have the chance to still live near a friend :)",Response from Chewy:Yup! You must indicate that you want “two singles” in the area that describes the rooms that work for you. Thanks for sharing!
44,Does anyone ever get an 'A' in writing sem?,Response from Chewy:Yeah. It’s rare but people do get it.
45,do you recommend emailing professors about final grades or just waiting? i would like to have an updated transcript/gpa for summer apps...,Response from Chewy:You can email them but only do so if they haven’t reported their grades beyond the grading deadline.
46,other ways to get housing/be able to stay for reunions w/o actually working reunions? like what other groups get to stay or are there other jobs u can do on campus?,"Response from Chewy:Performing arts groups usually stay for reunions, so you can get housing through that method."
47,I'm confused. I am a first year and was wondering if I needed to complete a pre-draw application if I want to have a single again. I am currently in a single (I think because of my medical condition) and want to have another single next year but the pre-draw application provides accommodations for one roommate or draw mate. I don't want any roommate. Any info is appreciated!,"Response from Olive:not sure if we’re looking at the same housing accommodations application but the one I’m looking at says “If you wish to have a roommate/drawmate, list them and include their class year. You may only bring one (1) person into the draw with you:” so it seems to be optional. you’ll need to do it because otherwise you’ll be in the general room draw with everyone else which doesn’t include rooms for those with accommodations."
48,"Who should I talk to about getting into grad school given a low GPA? I love doing research and will graduate with a lot of research experience, but I've been dropping the ball on coursework and my current GPA (engineering, going into junior spring) is a low 3. Feeling a sense of doom since I feel like my grades won't be good enough for top programs.","Response from Olive:the career center definitely has staff very familiar with grad school admissions processes, but you can also reach out to someone in your department who may be more knowledgeable about how to go about applying for grad school in your specific major. I think the general advice they’ll give is that GPA is just one factor grad schools take into account among many more. in your case, they may prefer someone with a lower gpa and a lot of relevant research experience over someone with a much higher gpa but lacks the same degree of experience. your primary task as an applicant is to highlight your strengths to schools in order to create a case for yourself and applications typically provide a lot of opportunities to do so whether it be research experience, essays, recommendations, etc. improving your gpa could also be something to aim for, but it’s also not the only thing you can do or what schools will care about."
49,"Will quintile rank be updated after today's grade submission deadline (1/9), or roughly how long until they are usually updated for the previous semester?",Response from Chewy:We don’t know when the registrar will update this information. Check back in a week or so.
50,How do I access quintile rank? Previous answers on this forum don’t seem to apply,Response from Olive:they aren’t updated for this sem yet but you can do enroll in courses -> term information -> view my quintile rank
51,Frosh here. The last math class I took was precalc in high school and did pretty well. Would MAT103 be too difficult to take right away? ,"Response from Heisenberg:Just take MAT 103. I don’t know what other courses/sequences you’re considering but MAT 100 is basically just the hardest parts of your precalc class, so it’s better to just rip off the bandaid by taking MAT 103 and save the extra course slot for a more worthwhile course. "
52,I got a fat 3.1 GPA as a frosh.,"Response from Olive:and that’s okay! many people felt disappointed in their first semester gpa (me) especially since most of us never received a final grade lower than an A, but this is also a totally new and much more academically competitive environment for many people as well. the first semester gpa is a pretty biased metric since it’s based on only usually 4 courses where as when you graduate you’ll have completed either 31 (AB) or 35 (BSE), so non-A scores heavily skew it downwards. you have a lot of potential room for improvement and plenty of time to do it, so I wouldn’t stress too much. I would take some time to reflect on what could have led to this and maybe try to think of ways to fix it. were you just not interested in your classes? do you think you prepared well for exams? did you use all of the academic resources available to you? these can be good starting points in determining what may have went wrong. I know it can take some time to get past, but the new semester brings new opportunities to improve your gpa and I’m confident you’ll be able to."
53,"is it just me (ab) or do i feel like bse students are generally way better at everything compared to ab students? tbh most people here are good at writing essays and doing humanities stuff, but i'd say most ab students (with the exception of pure math/physics majors) are complete dogshit at anything stem related. my roommate (also ab student) once told me 1/3+1/4 = 1/7. also my professors have told me that often times bse students are their best, but no bse profs say ab are their best","Response from Chewy:I would say that your comment holds true for BSE students and math/physics majors regarding STEM-related things, as they must have those skills to survive their major, which means they have a higher baseline for “smartness.”After all, there is a reason why most AB students choose their major in the humanities, as we would die in the physics, chemistry, and math requirements needed there. But not everyone is terrible at STEM-related things, such as students who major in CHM, EEB, MOL, NEU, and ECO, just to name a few. I know quite a few people in those departments who are extremely smart.Response from Heisenberg:I have observed this as well, but this is the wrong mindset to be maintaining during your years here at Princeton."
54,"does a professor have the ability to enroll me in classes? currently looking to enroll in classes where i dont meet the prereqs (309 is only for sophs, but im a frosh and have finished 245) or other restrictions",Response from Olive:the professor can’t enroll you in the class themselves but they can get someone in their department to allow you to enroll on TigerHub if they choose to do soResponse from Heisenberg:I know a handful of freshmen who enrolled in 309 so just ask away
55,What's considered a good GPA for a freshman AB in economics/social sciences for the first semester? Does it tend to be that classes get harder as the years progress?,"Response from Chewy:In the economics/social sciences world, a GPA above 3.5 is considered “good.” But assessing a GPA off of one semester isn’t a reliable indicator of your abilities, so take it with a grain of salt.Classes tend to get harder until junior year, which balances out as you have a better grip on studying and take electives that are reasonable for your interests and preferences."
56,What is the cutoff for an A in phy101?,readers?
57,"Has anyone done or heard of the Centro Panamericano de Idiomas - CPI Spanish language school in Costa Rica? If so, what were your thoughts?",readers?
58,does anyone know how paying for an IUD insertion at UHS works if you have private insurance ?,"Response from Olive:I think it would just get billed to the insurance plan owner (presumably a parent) and they would pay it once they receive it however they usually do. if you’re worried about privacy or a parent finding out, you could try asking if you can pay for it at the office, but the insurance owner would still be able to find out about from their account if they looked into it."
59,"how bad is living in 1901 hall in terms of cleanliness, bugs, and noise","Response from Olive:I think in terms of bugs and cleanliness it’s still part of the slums which aren’t great, but I think it tends to be a little cleaner and have fewer bugs. the noise in the courtyard / dorms can be pretty bad on nights out "
60,Is it bad that I want to hookup with a grad student as a first-year? I just like mature women lol.,"Response from Olive:I think if it’s in the context of a current preceptor of yours then I would probably say so because it can make it difficult to maintain a professional relationship with them, but if it’s not I think it’s okay. age preference is a pretty common thing in sexual relationships since there are definitely people interested in others that are many years younger / older than them."
61,Can you just lie about your GPA for PICS and other Pton things? Who cares lol.,Response from Olive:nothing stopping you but pretty sure they can check your GPA without your permission to verify and potentially disqualify you from consideration if they find out. GPA is only a part of it and usually isn’t a deciding factor for PICS and other internships but rather interest
62,Is $600/week enough for anything in regard to the PICS internships? Like actually poverty for no reason lol,"Response from Olive:`this may depend on where you plan on interning geographically. for example, if you’re in nyc / dc it may be a little tight, but I think the biggest expense you can potentially cut costs on is housing since I think many interns room together when they can for cheaper housing / social networking. I didn’t do PICS but last summer I spent about $4k living in a major city for 8 weeks with most of it being rent, so it’s definitely doable with some extra leftover. They definitely take costs into consideration since they’ve been offering PICS for quite some time, so they’ve received a lot of feedback about the sufficiency of the compensation and adjusted for inflation when necessary."
63,"I'm applying for PICS internships rn and want to put my GPA on my resume, but one of my courses hasn't released grades yet. I'm a freshman so if the grade isn't good my GPA could be significantly different from the one currently on my tigerhub. Is it a bad idea to write down the temporary GPA that only represents 3/4 of my classes?",Response from Chewy:I don’t think so. I would submit whichever GPA is shown in Tigerhub right before the 1/9 deadline since that’s the only GPA number you have.
64,Highest paying jobs? Not really interested in anything and just want to get that bag really,"Response from Chewy:Quant, SWE, IB, and Consulting."
65,How is MAT103 for someone who sucks at math but wants to potentially be a Neuro major? I mean like I can do Algebra 2 at most rn lol.,"Response from Heisenberg:It’ll be tough, as all Princeton maths courses are, but you shouldn’t let it stop you from pursuing neuro!! Solve as many practice problems as you can (just reading the material is insufficient), go to office hours the instant you have any questions, and monitor your progress so you make an informed decision whether to (stay in, PDF the, drop the) class. You got this!!"
66,What is the deal with the Bogle Fellowship and Service focus? Is it only for 1st-years?,"Response from Heisenberg:Bogle Fellowship is available for first-years, sophomores, and juniors. Service Focus prioritizes first-years and sophomores."
67,Anybody had experience transferring from ab to bse after first sem (did not take phy103)? Will this be allowed as the BSE program requires students to finish the physics sequence by the end of first year. Will I be blocked from declaring a major and applying for CPT for a summer internship then? I emailed dean bogucki alrdy but some insights before school starts when I get to meet with him will be greatly appreciated as I plan for my next semester and summer. Thanks!,"Response from Heisenberg:If physics is all that’s left for your BSE prereqs, you can definitely still take PHY 103 and PHY 104 during sophomore year. I switched to BSE after my second semester with three missing BSE prereqs; just make sure you have a plan laid out to complete them and the rest of your chosen BSE major’s degree requirements in a timely manner. Bogucki should allow you to switch as long as you’re asserting that you have things all planned out."
68,"In your opinion, what percentage of a 3.9 do you have to reach for it to round up to a 4.0 (for job applications and CVs?) I feel like a 4.0 is always taken to mean ""perfect undergraduate record"" but after 1 B and many semesters of As, the number of hundredths of a 4.0 just keeps getting bigger. ","Response from Chewy:To be frank, the Center for Career development at Princeton will have a much more informed answer than we do.GPA on a CV should be rounded to the nearest hundredth. For jobs that round GPA to the nearest tenth, it may be ok to round up at a 3.96 or above. "
69,It’s been a while since I’ve been on campus; do the dining halls still have containers where you can take food to go (as in the first post-Covid semesters)?,Response from Fallon: not anymore!
70,when do seniors usually secure a post-grad job? feels like a lot of my friends already know where they're working after graduation and i'm falling behind...,"Response from Chewy:It may be the case that many of your senior friends work in industries that recruit very early, such as consulting, investment banking, and technology, so they generally know where they’re working after graduation. However, this is only the case for a minority of the senior population, and many seniors will recruit in the spring or post-grad summer to secure their job, which is where you may fall. Furthermore, the current job market is grim with the “recession” and “cost-cutting” that many companies are doing, so it’ll take quite a bit to secure a post-grad job this year."
71,"for neuro, could you pdf the math prereq and the physics requirement?","Response from Heisenberg:The department says this: “Students must receive a passing grade in each prerequisite course in order to enter the neuroscience concentration.” Seems like as long as you pass those classes, you should be fine -> PDF is fine."
72,Is LENS actually anything new? As far as I can tell it is just a new website for the internship programs that already existed.,Response from Heisenberg:It’s a scam. Lol jkjk — it’s essentially a centralized bulletin board for all the internship resources that Princeton has to offer. Makes stuff easier to find I suppose. There’s fine print in some announcement somewhere about details that they’ve added to the program.
73,what is the summa GPA cutoff for politics?,Readers?
74,for cum laude/magna/summa is it determined by overall gpa or departmental gpa?,Response from Chewy:Departmental GPA.
75,Is Tigermatch legit?,Response from Chewy:Yup! I don’t think it’s widely used as much anymore though.Response from Heisenberg:Need to petition for the creators to bring the service back expeditiously
76,"follow up to tigerhub question: if they made the change before jan 9th but it just doesn’t update, will it still eventually update afterwards? or like is everything locked after the 9th",Response from Olive:I think grade changes technically have to be approved by the senior associate dean of the college to ensure it’s within reason and then it can be processed. grades can still be inputted / changed past jan 9th so I wouldn’t worry about it.
77,Are the faith-based internships just scams?,"Response from Olive:no, a University-sponsored, approved, and funded internship is not a scam."
78,"if you had to estimate, what percentage of frosh have a 4.0 after first semester?","Response from Heisenberg:I know a lot of people who had really easy 4-class semesters (e.g. no writing sem, super easy freshman sem, taking classes equivalent to what they alr took in hs, selectively choosing easy classes to get accustomed to Princeton workload). Then throw in a few geniuses into the mix and you probably have anywhere between 50 to 150 students so like 4-12%? "
79,"does tigerhub take a little to update? i was able to have my prof change a final grade and he said he put the change in the system, but im still not seeing the change on my end. don’t wanna keep bothering him w emails but ik grades are due soon",Response from Heisenberg:Yeah they take forever
80,"should i move up to mat204 in the spring? took 201 fall, which felt hard despite multi experience but managed a safe A. realized i might be interested in theoretical cs research and wanted to get experience with proofy stuff (have none now). worried about the difficulty/time commitment, as i have phy104, writing sem, cos226, and another dist. req that i would need to find (because mat204 conflicts with the one i have now). regardless, i would take cos240 or mat215 soph fall","Response from Heisenberg:Given your interest in CS, there’s this really interesting line from the math department regarding 204: “The course will present various applications of linear algebra in graph and network theory, cryptography, image compression, probability and statistics, machine learning, principal component analysis, linear, constrained, and regularized least-square optimization, ranking algorithms (least-squares, Google page rank), and SVD-based recommendation engine (Netflix).” Shopping 204 for the first week or so and dropping to 202 if the time commitment proves to be too much is something reasonable you could do."
81,what are the prereqs for ECO363? can't find prereqs for it on the registrar page for some reason,Response from Heisenberg:Used to be a mix of ECO 300/310 and ECO 362 but they’re really not necessary
82,"if MAT175 is listed as a prereq for a course, do you have to take 202 to fulfill the equivalent or just 201?","Response from Heisenberg:175 is more focused on 201 material, so take 201"
83,do pdf/pdfo classes count toward your gpa in any way? or do they not affect your gpa? thanks!,Response from Heisenberg:Grades in PDF’d courses are omitted from GPA calculations
84,"PSIP: most if not all are programs provided by organizations or companies associated with Princeton alumni. So are some of the winter internships. For first year students who don’t have much experience or cannot get other internship opportunities, the school is trying to take care of them by getting alumni to help and fund these programs, some with overseas visits.",RT
85,does anyone know why ncw is still not on hoagiemail? i genuinely feel like i miss out on so much as an ncw student because of this. i heard its something to do with the dsl (garrett meggs?) but not sure,"Response from Chewy:NCW is the only res college listserv where you have to be an NCW student to be part of it. If you want to stay in touch with campus events, subscribe to one of the other res college listservs (Matheymail, Whitman Wire, ReINNformer, etc.) to stay in touch. The only restriction to these listservs is to be a Princeton student or faculty member."
86,Does block 105 include late meal?,"Response from Chewy:Yes, one late meal = one swipe. "
87,Is PSIP just a scam? Like bruh who wants to work at a no-name company in India or some other meh country? Bruh.,"Response from Ocean:Why would it be a scam…? Plenty of people want internships and are interested for working for start-ups, all of which are ‘no-name companies’ by definition. Also, in the future, not a good idea to refer to countries as 'meh countries’. It sounds racist. If you’re not interested, don’t apply. There are plenty of other internship opportunities to choose from. "
88,made it to interview round of glossgenius for psip... it's in 6 days and they just sent me the conference link today. there is no info on what to expect or how to prepare... is that supposed to be normal?,"Response from Ocean:Yes, that’s normal. Typically–unless the interview has some specific requirement, like a technical portion–this is how interviews are conducted, even for Princeton-specific opportunities.If you’d like information on what to expect or how to prepare, I’d first look to the Center for Career Development. "
89,How to ask out a girl without being referred to the Dean for sexual harassment? I'm serious.,"Response from Ocean:The wording of this question kind of makes it seems like you have been referred to the Dean for sexual harassment…? If this is the case, I’d encourage you to speak to SHARE, the confidential campus resource for sexual harassment. You can talk about what happened with a trained counselor or SHARE peer, and both of you can try and figure out what happened, where you made a mistake (if you indeed did), and how to go about it for next time. I’m serious about this. I know the resource is primarily for victims of sexual harassment, but that’s not the only thing they do. And I think it could be a confidential, non-judgemental place in which to discuss the specifics of your case without worrying about reporting.But to answer your actual question. I think mostly you need to be clear about what you’re asking, look for signs that the girl is interested in such a romantic proposal, and keep it casual and low-pressure. It is also ideal if you know the girl well, and if you already have somewhat of a flirtatious relationship or are both interested in each other. However, sometimes you can’t really tell. It’s not a good idea to make it a huge deal, to give a long speech about why she should say yes (rom coms are not real life, y'all), or to ask multiple times if she’s already said no. Also kind of obvious, but don’t insinuate something sexual (or expect it, after you’ve been on the date). An example of a good way: “Hey [name], I like you and I was wondering if you would like to go on a date with me sometime. We could [get coffee/go to a concert/get dinner].”Simple, low pressure. If she says no, try to just shrug it off and move on. Don’t ask again–assume the answer will still be no. If she says she’s not sure or needs to think about it, then just say okay and ask her to let you know when she’s decided (and move on in the conversation). If she never brings it up, you can ask again (once!), again casually (“About what I asked you on Monday, did you make up your mind on if you would like to go on a date with me?”). After that, consider it a no and move on. Hope this answers your question. (source: have asked out girls before)"
90,my father is an incredibly toxic and abusive person. i'm afraid i can no longer live under the same roof as him without being constantly denigrated & like i'm losing my sanity. where can i access the continuous housing application for summer 2023? and most importantly: who can i speak to about my experiences? i definitely don't feel like i can be vulnerable enough to open up to evenclose friends about this & i'm scared that severing ties with my dad will mean the loss of my other family members,"Response from Ocean:I’m so sorry you’re going through this! I don’t think the application for continuous housing for summer is open yet, but when it is, you’ll be able to access it through the Princeton Service Portal. I’ve never applied for continuous housing myself, but this is what the Housing website says. For reference, the winter continuous housing application closed at the end of November, and students got several emails mentioning it. I’d imagine for summer it wouldn’t open up until after Spring Break. On the plus side, I don’t know of anyone who’s gotten rejected from continuous housing for identity-based concerns such as this one. As for your more important question, you have several resources and people you can talk to.First, I would like to mention your DSL/Assistant Dean for Student Life. They are there to help, and can definitely help with your continuous housing application and other concerns you have housing-wise. They can also help connect you to other resources as needed. If you still live in your residential college, you also have a Residential Life Coordinator and an RCA/ARCA. These people are also here to help/listen to your concerns. If you’re comfortable with your RCA/ARCA, just ask to talk to them. A big chunk of our jobs is just listening to students, I’ve done things like this several times before. They will also handle your information sensitively and privately, and you don’t have to worry about anyone else finding out. If you got along well with one of your past RCAs, and you still have their contact info, I’m sure they’d be happy to hear from you as well, even if it is just to unload on them.Finally, there is CPS. I saved this for last not because it is less important than the other resources, but because I’m sure this is kind of an obvious answer you may have considered before. I know some students have their frustrations with CPS, but I’ve always gotten what I needed from them. They’re very familiar with dealing with these types of family issues, it comes up a lot with college students. (It’s your first time living on your own, your childhood is still fresh in your mind, you’re still working out the kind of relationship you want to have with your parents/family as an adult.) They can also refer you to an outside therapist that accepts your health insurance, which can be a very helpful space to process all of this and try and figure out your next steps. Therapy has been important for me and for many of my friends, and I’d encourage you to seek it out even if you feel like there’s nothing ‘wrong’ with you. It is designed to be a private, confidential space for you to process this on your own and with guidance from a professional. Good luck, and sending well wishes to you. "
91,"If one of my classes that didn't have a final still hasn't inputted the grade, should I email the professor or just wait until the deadline for all grades on Monday?",Response from Olive:technically the Monday deadline is only a suggestion and there aren’t any consequences for submitting past the deadline so it’s unfortunately just a waiting game until they submit the grades. you can try to email to get an idea of when they may be available but the professor is likely working to ensure they’re in as soon as possible because I’m sure they get bugged about it from admin.
92,can you audit a grad class,Response from Olive:as long as it says “Audit” under the grading basis on its course offerings page then yes
93,When is dev psych final grades coming out!,"Response from Olive:literally what I’ve been asking myself all week lol, deadline is Monday but hopefully earlierupdate: we definitely manifested them coming out today"
94,"for the freshman first honor prize, is it awarded based on gpa? or what are the criteria?",Response from Chewy:It looks to be a combination of GPA and difficulty in classes. Research may also help to establish academic rigor.
95,what exactly are eating club formals?,"Response from Chewy:Eating club formals are similar to a fancy sit-down dinner + party, where eating club members and their guests dress up for this event. Some eating clubs invite live entertainment to their formals. "
96,is it possible to take a math course for a requirement over the summer while also having an internship? like do other colleges have online courses that would work with the times I'm available?,"Response from Halocline:definitely! i took MAE305/MAT391 last summer — important thing is you start looking early, as the deadlines for applying for transfer credit and registering will sneak up on you. look first at your local/state university to see if they have any online classes at nighttime, but rutgers tends to have a strong offering of classes if you need and can be good if you’re staying near campus for the summer"
97,"reunions job applications due soon, any update on reunions questions?","I don’t think so, and we haven’t received responses from readers yet. Readers?"
98,where can i reserve a room that is as quiet as possible? need to take a big exam,Response from Chewy:Lewis Library study rooms are a good choice.
99,junior who has no idea what they want to do after graduation. i’ve been a people pleaser for so long that i’m not even sure what i’m genuinely interested in. please help,"Response from Chewy:I would consider what industry you want to be a part of. In which areas are you passionate? Do you prefer a quantitative role? Do you like to pitch and convince others in marketing? Are you someone who likes to research? Do you like to solve problems such as that in consulting or product management?Being a “people pleaser” is crucial in numerous jobs, so it’s hard to help you with that one piece of information. A great resource is to make an appointment with the Center for Career Development at Princeton and discuss your options there."
